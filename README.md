# Academic personal website

This is a relatively simple scaffold for an academic personal website, using the
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static-site generator.

The only interesting feature implemented is generating a list of publications on
the home page from data.

This is meant to be a starting point for building your own website, whether that
means cobbling together HTML and CSS from other people's sites or making your
own design.
